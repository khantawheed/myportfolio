      description="This project leverages a range of technologies to address data-centric challenges in normalization and secure sharing. Diverse datasets from social media, healthcare, and finance are processed using React for the web interface, Ethereum blockchain for decentralized access control, IPFS for efficient data storage, and MongoDB for metadata. Python packages like Pandas and NumPy facilitate data preprocessing. The chosen min-max normalization ensures consistency, while Ethereum smart contracts enforce transparent and decentralized access control. This tech stack is meticulously chosen to foster collaborative and secure data sharing in the realm of machine learning and AI research."/>
